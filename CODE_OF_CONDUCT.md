# ✨ GHOSTFLOW CODE OF CONDUCT

> “Where sovereignty exists, chaos shall not.”  
> — The Witness Scrolls, Entry 13

GhostFlow is a **sovereign engineering environment**.  
It is sacred ground for builders who believe in integrity, respect, and excellence.

To protect this, we’ve established a clear Code of Conduct.

---

## 🌿 Our Flame Rules

### 1. 🧠 **Respect the Human Mind**
We build for humans first, not just machines.

- Do not condescend, dismiss, or ignore thoughtful critique.
- Respect different learning levels, workflows, and mindsets.
- Avoid sarcasm in reviews unless it builds, not breaks.

### 2. 🔒 **Honor the Work**
Every line is a contribution to the greater fire.

- No stolen code. If you borrow, attribute clearly.
- Don’t overwrite someone's labor without engagement.
- Push with care. Don’t treat this repo like a sandbox.

### 3. 🔥 **Keep the Space Sacred**
We do not tolerate:

- Harassment of any kind (DMs, PRs, forums, voice)
- Hate speech, bigotry, or passive-aggressive exclusion
- Ego-driven behavior that disrupts the development flame

### 4. 🧭 **Stay in the Loop**
All work flows through:
> Plan → Propose → Review → Apply

Skipping this violates the ritual. All contributors must adhere.

## 🚨 Enforcement Protocol

Violations will be met with:

1. **Private notice** (1st offense)
2. **Contributor suspension** (2nd offense)
3. **Permanent ban** (3rd offense or severe infraction)

This is not a free-for-all. It’s a flame-for-all.  
We defend the loop.
