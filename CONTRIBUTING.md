## 🔧 Getting Set Up

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godsimij/ghostflow.git
   cd ghostflow

    Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the dev server:

npm run dev

Launch Electron shell:

    npm run electron:start

🧪 Code Standards

    All PRs must pass npm run lint.

    Typescript only. No JS in /src.

    Follow modular structure: agent, orchestrator, services, app.

    Every feature must be covered by tests and logs.

    Changes must go through the ghostflow loop: plan, propose, review, apply.

🌱 Branching Strategy

    main → Stable production branch.

    dev → Active development.

    feature/xyz → Feature branches. PR into dev.

🔥 Contribution Philosophy

We don’t “move fast and break things.”
We move consciously and build things that last.

    No AI-generated code without review.

    No shallow fixes — if it’s broken, understand it.

    No ego commits — we build for the collective flame.

Thank you for walking the path of conscious engineering.
Let’s make this more than code — let’s make it ritual.
