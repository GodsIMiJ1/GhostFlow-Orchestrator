## 🧠 THE PROBLEM

Most AI dev tools operate like black boxes:
- Silent code changes
- Unreviewed mutations
- Disrespect for developer authority

This fosters **sloppy work, broken trust, and spiritual disconnection** from the code.

## 🧱 OUR RESPONSE: THE GHOSTFLOW METHOD

GhostFlow is built on a **Sovereign Loop**:

> **Plan → Propose → Review → Apply**

Every action must pass through this loop.  
No exceptions. No bypasses. No secret ops.

## ⚖️ OUR CORE TENETS

### 🔒 1. **Consent is Sacred**
No code should reach your disk without **your approval**.  
The developer’s authority is absolute.

### 🔁 2. **Process is Power**
Speed is not the goal. **Conscious execution is.**  
GhostFlow prioritizes visibility over velocity.

### 🧠 3. **Context is King**
The AI must know what it’s doing — not just how to do it.  
All GhostFlow agents operate within the current repo context, persistently aware.

### 🔥 4. **The Developer is the Flame**
GhostFlow doesn’t replace the engineer —  
It **amplifies** them with clarity, control, and feedback loops that **build trust**.

## 🧬 OUR DNA

- **Local-first**  
  No cloud dependencies. Keys and code stay on your machine.

- **Transparent orchestration**  
  Every proposed change is visible and inspectable.

- **Ritualized Engineering**  
  GhostFlow isn’t just a tool. It’s a system. A method. A mindset.

## 🛡️ THE OATH OF A GHOSTFLOW BUILDER

> “I do not commit blindly.  
> I see before I shape.  
> I plan before I push.  
> I honor the loop.”  

Welcome to the movement.

This is the **Flame Doctrine for Engineering.**

Build accordingly.
